**Project: Çilekli Muz** is a full de/compiler for Soulcalibur III's Tales of Souls files. Currently in the **nightly alpha** stages of development.

## The Prospect

This project is a full de/compiler for Soulcalibur III's Tales of Souls files. Currently, it is only a compiler with the basic necessities to create a functional story. However, it is in seldom-active development and will see more updates as time marches on.

## The Technical Stuff

The project uses the Godot Engine for it's UI/UX, and it is made entirely using it's Mono interface. 

## The Meaning

This project is dedicated to it's namesake, **Armağan Yalçın**, without whom I would never be even able to start this project, let alone come this far into it.  
_Armağan, I love you. Thank you._
